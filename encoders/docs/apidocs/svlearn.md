## `svlearn.common` package


## Overview

The `svlearn.common` package is a versatile utility package designed to provide essential building blocks for a wide range of Python projects within our organization. It offers a collection of utilities and base classes that streamline various tasks, including exception handling, logging setup, singleton decorators, and basic I/O operations. The package is intended to be a central repository of common functionality that is frequently needed across different projects, ensuring consistency and promoting code reuse.

You should include these utilities in all your projects at SupportVectors.
## Exception Handling Base Classes

Exception handling is a critical aspect of robust software development. The `svlearn.common` package provides base classes for custom exceptions, allowing developers to create meaningful and context-specific error messages. By extending these base classes, you can ensure that your project follows a consistent approach to error handling, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Logging Setup

Logging is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting applications. The package includes utilities for setting up and configuring loggers, enabling developers to easily integrate logging into their projects. The logging setup provided by `svlearn.common` adheres to our organization's standards, ensuring that logs are structured, informative, and easy to manage.

## Singleton Decorator

The singleton design pattern is often useful when you need to restrict a class to a single instance. The `svlearn.common` package provides a decorator that simplifies the implementation of the singleton pattern. This decorator can be applied to any class that should have only one instance, preventing unnecessary duplication and potential resource conflicts.

## I/O Utilities

Basic I/O operations, such as verifying the existence and writability of files and directories, are common tasks in many projects. The package includes utilities for performing these operations efficiently and reliably. These utilities help prevent common I/O issues and ensure that your project interacts with the file system in a safe and consistent manner.

## Conclusion

The `svlearn.common` package is an invaluable resource for developers working on Python projects within our organization. It provides a range of utilities and base classes that address common needs, promoting consistency, and encouraging best practices. By leveraging this package, developers can focus on building the unique aspects of their projects while relying on a solid foundation for common functionality.

## `svlearn.config` package
# `svlearn.config` Package

## Overview

The `svlearn.config` package is designed to streamline the configuration process for Python projects within our organization. This package provides utilities for reading configuration parameters from a YAML file, typically named `supportvectors-config.yaml`. The package helps to centralize and manage crucial application settings, such as the database server URL, machine-learning model names, configuration properties, and other key parameters.

## Purpose and Benefits

The primary purpose of the `svlearn.config` package is to provide a consistent and convenient way to manage application configurations. By using this package, developers benefit from:

1. **Centralized Configuration:** All important application settings are stored in one place, making it easy to review, update, and manage configurations.
2. **Consistency:** Using a standardized configuration file format across projects ensures consistency and reduces errors.
3. **Flexibility:** The package allows easy customization of settings without changing the codebase, enabling different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

## Reading Configuration

The `svlearn.config` package offers utilities to read and parse the `supportvectors-config.yaml` file, extracting relevant parameters for the application. The configuration file typically includes settings such as:

- **Database Configuration:** Details such as the database server URL, port, username, and password.
- **Model Configuration:** Names and properties of machine-learning models used in the application.
- **Application Settings:** General application parameters, such as logging levels, timeout values, and feature toggles.

### Example Configuration File

Below is an example of what a typical `supportvectors-config.yaml` file might look like:

```yaml
database:
  server_url: "localhost:5432"
  username: "admin"
  password: "secret"

model:
  name: "svm_classifier"
  hyperparameters:
    kernel: "linear"
    C: 1.0

settings:
  logging_level: "INFO"
  feature_toggle: true
```

### Loading Configuration

The `svlearn.config` package provides utilities to easily load and access these configuration settings. For example:

```python
import yaml
from svlearn.config import load_config

def load_config(file_path: str = "supportvectors-config.yaml"):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        config = yaml.safe_load(file)
    return config

config = load_config()

# Accessing configuration parameters
db_url = config["database"]["server_url"]
model_name = config["model"]["name"]
logging_level = config["settings"]["logging_level"]
```

## Best Practices

When using the `svlearn.config` package, follow these best practices:

1. **Use Descriptive Keys:** Ensure that the keys in the YAML file are descriptive and meaningful, making the configuration easy to understand.
2. **Secure Sensitive Information:** For sensitive information, such as database passwords, consider using environment variables or a secure vault.
3. **Validate Configuration:** Implement validation checks to ensure that required configuration parameters are present and valid.

## Conclusion

The `svlearn.config` package provides a robust and flexible solution for managing application configurations in our Python projects. By centralizing settings in a YAML file and providing utilities for easy access, the package enhances consistency and maintainability across different projects and environments.
